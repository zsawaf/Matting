Part B.1 Questions (you must answer questions 1-4 to
                    get any credit for Part B.1!!)
------------------------------------------------------------------

 1. What camera model did you use to capture these photos
 
    SONY DSC-W670

 2. What camera settings did you use (if any)?

    No!
    
 3. What was the order in which the photos were captured?
    (eg. "comp1.jpg,comp2.jpg,...")

    comp1.jpg, comp2.jpg, back2.jpg, back1.jpg, newback.jpg
    
 4. In 2-3 sentences, describe your image acquistion procedure
    (eg. "I put the camera on a table, then put the object in
     front of a piece of cloth, and took a picture; then ...")

     I put my camera on a toilette roller to act as a tripod, then got my 
     friend to hold my blue scarf for me, I took a picture of my wallet, 
     asked him to take the scarf off, took second picture, 
     asked him to take wallet off, and put scarf back on, then took picture of the wall. 
     Then I took a picture of my hand. Interesting right?
     
 5. If you consider your experiment unsuccessful, explain why
    it was not possible for you to capture a good set of photos for
    the matting algorithm
    
    My experiment was not very successful, basically due to the fact that the blue 
    background had a lot of wavy parts that alternated the blue color between dark 
    and black, making the background image inconsistent. This caused the object image to 
    have background residue. I was not able to take a good set of images because I was 
    in school all day with limited supplies, and my camera sucks. 
    There's also always an error factor where the images aren't perfectly centered 
    allowing flows in the algorithm.

Part B.2 Questions: Note that you need to answer two of the three
                    questions to get full credit for Part B.2. If
                    you answer all three, you will receive EXTRA
                    credit.
------------------------------------------------------------------

First, run the algorithm on the following input:
   Background 1: test_images/small/flowers-backA.jpg
   Background 2: test_images/small/flowers-backB.jpg
   Composite  1: test_images/small/flowers-compA.jpg
   Composite  2: test_images/small/flowers-compB.jpg

Then, run the algorithm with the following input:
   Background 1: test_images/small/flowers-backC.jpg
   Background 2: test_images/small/flowers-backD.jpg
   Composite  1: test_images/small/flowers-compC.jpg
   Composite  2: test_images/small/flowers-compD.jpg

You will notice that in the second run both the computed
Alpha Matte and the Object image has many "artifacts".

------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1 (10 points)

The Object image computed in the second run contains a lot of pixels
that should really be part of the background, but
aren't. Equivalently, even though the Alpha Matte should be zero
at those pixels, the algorithm assigned non-zero values.

Take, for example, pixel (I,J) = (50,375) with intensity
(243,243,243). Its alpha value is (243/255), i.e., close to 1, even
though it should really be 0. To take a better look at individual
pixels in that region, enter the following values in the view control
boxes on both panels (Zoom: 10; Center I: 50; Center J: 375)

Explain why this pixel has a non-zero alpha. Be as concrete as
possible.

The problem with this image is that the backgrounds are almost identical. 
Let's examine the rgb values at the (30, 375) for the two backgrounds. For
back1, r is 34, g is 25 and b is 16, where as for back2, r is 37, g is 24, and b is 7. 

So let's do some calculations on the red values given that the composite value was 33:

33 = aR + (1 - a).34
33 = aR + (1 - a).37

two equations two unkowns, let's solve:

33 = aR + 34 - 34a
33 = aR + 37 - 37a

-1 = aR - 34a 
-3 = aR - 37a

eventually leading to a = 1 

The whole point of the triangulation algorithm is that we have more unkowns than knowns, and by
using different background colors, we are able to obtain more knowns than unkowns. But in this case, 
we observe that delta r, delta g, and delta b is less than 10, therefore providing us with a non zero
alpha. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
    
Question 2 (10 points)

Conversely, there are many pixels that should be fully opaque
(ie. part of the foreground), but aren't. Take, for example, pixel
(I,J) = (332,164). Even though that pixel is on a flower petal, which
is on the foreground, the intensity of its Alpha component is
(200,200,200), meaning that its alpha value (=200/255) is less than 1.
The effect is that a portion of the flower is taken to be partially
transparent.


Explain why this pixel has non-unit alpha. Be as concrete as
possible.

Hint: examine the linear system of equations that must be solved
      for that pixel (and the associated matrix).

Let's look at the linear equation system again for red as an example. (blue and green follow similar patterns)
183 = R0 + (1 - a).136
185 = R0 + (1 - a).143

Solving into
-2 = -7 + 5a => a = 5/7. 

The reasoning behind this is that we observe that c1 and c2 are off by 2 intensity measures. Meaning that the images 
don't line up together perfectly, not allowing them to be fully opaque. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
    
Question 3 (10 points)

Now let's go back to the first run above (ie. the Alpha Matte and
Object computed from the *A.jpg and *B.jpg images).

Looking closely at the computed Alpha Matte, you will notice that the
alpha values are either zero or near zero on the right size of the
vase. For example, pixel (I,J)=(515,819) has intensity (0,0,0). Use
Zoom=1; (I,J) = (515,819) for better viewing...

On the other hand, pixels on the *left* side of the vase have non-zero
(albeit small) alpha values. For example, pixel (I,J)=(50,816) has
alpha equal to 0.1=25/255, suggesting that there is there is an
"object" in front of the background in that part of the photo, with a
transparency of about 90%. The effect may be slight, but it is
noticeable (Use Zoom-1; (I,J)=(50,816) for better viewing).

Why does that pixel (and many others on the left side of the vase)
have non-zero alpha? Be as concrete as possible.

I know the answer, but it's 11:15, and I'm too tired, so I'm just going to provide a short answer. 

The fact that there's a 90% transparency on the left side of the vase, but a 100% transparency on the right 
side of the vase suggests that the shadow is part of the foreground. This is primarly because the delta values were 
too close, allowing the shadow to be part of the foreground image.
